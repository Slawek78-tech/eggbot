# Wireless egg-bot (sphere-o-bot)

This is the source repository of my take at the sphere-o-bot from jjrobots. The original project can be found here: http://www.jjrobots.com/product/sphere-o-bot/

For this project I've printed the frame from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1956649 and the parts from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1683764.

The supplied source code is meant to be used with Inkscape and the gcodetools from http://www.cnc-club.ru/gcodetools. The motors are controlled by a MotorShield V2 from Adafruit and their respective library.

## Finished project
